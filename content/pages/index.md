        content: >
          We are serious alcoholics that are passionate about generating income
          while enjoying what we do. When we tasted our first seltzer together
          as a team some time back, we had a dream of launching and owning our
          very own seltzer line. Bonus: it is also gluten-free!

          We want to create our unique hard seltzer for the community. It also
          adds real-life utility to our TipsyTigers NFT. Why wear a merch when
          you can drink it? The Tipsy Tiger seltzer line is also one of the ways
          we market TipsyTigers NFT while giving back to TipsyTiger Club members
          with the profit-sharing model, creating an extra stream of income for
          our degen cubs through physical sales.

      - content: >
          TipsyTiger Hard Seltzer will be an extension of the TipsyTiger Club.
          From collaborations to sponsorships, the drink unlocks endless
          possibilities to market the TipsyTiger Club. We have intentionally
          added the TipsyTiger NFT to the logo. This radiates the presence of
          our brand around the world. Imagine TipsyTiger NFT in every party and
          club and people chugging shotguns with your PFP on every can. What a
          sight that will be.

          The team behind TipsyTiger Club are successful owners of prominent
          restaurants, bars, and cocktail delivery services. Packaging and
          product research and development are already underway. The next step
          will be the acquisition of our very own physical brewery. Once all
          TipsyTigers are fully minted, we will proceed with official
          productions. From launch parties to collaborations with DJs, sporting
          events, TipsyTiger Club will focus on marketing after mint to make the
          brand go viral worldwide.
