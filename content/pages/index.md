      Do you love alcohol? Do you feel like there is something larger than life
      waiting to happen? Do you sometimes wonder if you could be part of a fun
      and engaging party community from around the world?


      **Well, Congratulations. You found the TipsyTiger Club!**


      You’re about to be part of an ultra-exclusive community of alcoholic party
      degens cubs in the metaverse.


      The TipsyTiger Club is home to 10,000 unique TipsyTigers NFT generated
      from 140+ hand-drawn traits. We are the party degens of the metaverse.  If
      parties, drinks, raves surge through your veins, snag a TipsyTiger to be
      part of this revolutionary movement. This is a no bullshit NFT project -
      no cliché roadmap, no lame milestones, original giveaways. Just us being
      us, loving dranks, crypto, parties, all things NFT. And we are looking for
      like-minded degens to be a part of our family.

    content: >
      Now, what if the booze never stops flowing? And then, we had a lightbulb
      moment, why don’t we OWN A BREWERY?


      With that idea, TipsyTigers will be launching the world’s first NFT
      themed, TipsyTiger Hard Seltzer. Our NFTs will be engraved on every single
      seltzer can and shipped all over the continents for our party degens cubs
      and for the world to enjoy.


      Being a TipsyTiger Club member, you will be invited to exclusive launch
      parties around the world with other degen cubs. Join us for private raves,
      city view rooftop parties, and meet-ups in NYC, London, Singapore, and
      more.


      We are also a premium DAO. 50% of all secondary sales royalties and 20% of
      all sales profit from Hard Seltzer will be deposited to the DAO community
      wallet. Who says you can’t make money while drinking and partying?

        content: >
          We are serious alcoholics that are passionate about generating income
          while enjoying what we do. When we tasted our first seltzer together
          as a team some time back, we had a dream of launching and owning our
          very own seltzer line. Bonus: it is also gluten-free!

          We want to create our unique hard seltzer for the community. It also
          adds real-life utility to our TipsyTigers NFT. Why wear a merch when
          you can drink it? The Tipsy Tiger seltzer line is also one of the ways
          we market TipsyTigers NFT while giving back to TipsyTiger Club members
          with the profit-sharing model, creating an extra stream of income for
          our degen cubs through physical sales.

      - content: >
          TipsyTiger Hard Seltzer will be an extension of the TipsyTiger Club.
          From collaborations to sponsorships, the drink unlocks endless
          possibilities to market the TipsyTiger Club. We have intentionally
          added the TipsyTiger NFT to the logo. This radiates the presence of
          our brand around the world. Imagine TipsyTiger NFT in every party and
          club and people chugging shotguns with your PFP on every can. What a
          sight that will be.

          The team behind TipsyTiger Club are successful owners of prominent
          restaurants, bars, and cocktail delivery services. Packaging and
          product research and development are already underway. The next step
          will be the acquisition of our very own physical brewery. Once all
          TipsyTigers are fully minted, we will proceed with official
          productions. From launch parties to collaborations with DJs, sporting
          events, TipsyTiger Club will focus on marketing after mint to make the
          brand go viral worldwide.
