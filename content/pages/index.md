    title: WELCOME TO THE TIPSYTIGER CLUB
    content: >
      The year is 2046. An electric jolt from your watch shocks you awake. You
      open your eyes to find yourself in an unfamiliar environment. Random
      scenes from the night before flash through your mind. “GM buddy last night
      was hella lit!” a chirpy voice greets you. Ah, you remember now. The
      annual TipsyTiger Party you flew halfway around the globe to attend. “It
      was crazy but I’d live it again anytime.” You weakly reply as you fall
      back asleep.


      The annual TipsyTiger party is the one party you organise your entire
      year’s schedule around so as to not miss it. Every year, you fly to a
      different city to meet your TipsyTiger Club friends for this single party.
      The most extravagant and luxurious parties you’ve ever attended were held
      by the TipsyTiger Club. You chanced upon this club years ago. United by a
      passion for partying, TipsyTiger Club is home to successful entrepreneurs
      and early believers of the metaverse from around the world.


      It feels like centuries have passed when you wake up again. You reach out
      for your iPhone 38, intending to head straight into the Metaverse app to
      collect your daily ETH reward for staking NFTs and water the grass in all
      your virtual houses. You open your eyes to see your iPhone1 3. Wait for
      what? Is there a glitch? You clench your eyes shut tightly to gain
      clarity. Get it together! With all the courage you peel open your eyes.
      It’s 2021 again.


      The metaverse is still in the works. Metamask doesn’t allow you to view
      your NFTs. TipsyTiger Club is not yet formed. 


      Oh no, you think. I’ll have to bring the band together for all the crazy
      parties we’ll have. You remember joining as a member the first time. It’ll
      be fun to do this again. See you all in 2046.
